# Pasta

## Fresh Tomato Pasta
[@ruhlmanMichaelRuhlmanPasta]

* 4 ripe tomatoes, large dice
* 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt
* 12 ounces spaghetti or any pasta you like
* 10 cloves of garlic
* 1 cup basil, cut into ribbons
* 3 ounces butter, cut into three chunks
* Olive oil, as needed

1. Season the tomatoes with the salt and toss them well.
2. Put a big pot of water on to boil.
3. Smash the garlic with the flat side of a knife, give it all a few rough chops with the knife and set them a side in a small bowl.
4. Cut the basil into ribbons or roughly chop it. Take a pinch of this basil, chop it finely, and add it to the tomatoes to season the water.
5. Cook your pasta, drain it, put it back in the pot, and oil the pasta to keep it from sticking to itself. (Meanwhile, even if your water isn’t boiling yet, you should still get your garlic cooking in the next step).
6. Heat a teaspoon or two of olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, add the garlic and cook it till it is just beginning to brown around the edges and soften, a couple minutes. Give it a pinch of salt if you wish.
7. Pour the tomatoes into a strainer or colander over the garlic so that the tomato water will stream into the pan below. Set the strainer with the tomatoes into the bowl so they don’t drip on the counter, and swirl the sauce to bring it to a simmer. Add the butter while continuing to swirl or stir the sauce. Keep the sauce moving until all the butter is melted. Add the pasta and toss to coat the pasta evenly. Divide the pasta among four bowls and top with the tomatoes and basil.

## Pressure Cooker Pho
[@SeriousEatsDestination]

* 2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
* 2 medium yellow onions, split in half
* 1 small hand of ginger, roughly sliced
* 1 small bunch cilantro
* 3 star anise pods
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 4 cloves
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
* 6 to 8 chicken drumsticks
* 1/4 cup fish sauce, plus more to taste
* 2 tablespoons rock sugar or raw sugar, plus more to taste

 1. Heat oil in a pressure cooker over high heat until smoking. Add halved onions and ginger, cut side down. Cook without moving, reducing heat if smoking excessively, until onion and ginger are well charred, about 5 minutes.

2. Add cilantro, star anise, cinnamon, cloves, fennel seed, coriander, and chicken to the pot. Add 2 quarts of water, the fish sauce, and the sugar to the pot. Seal the pressure cooker and bring it to high pressure over high heat. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes, then shock under cold running water in the sink (or release pressure valve if using an electric pressure cooker).

3. Open pressure cooker. Transfer chicken legs to a plate. Pour broth through a fine mesh strainer into a clean pot and discard solids. Skim any scum off the surface of the broth using a ladle, but leave the small bubbles of fat intact. Season broth to taste with more fish sauce and sugar if desired.

4. To serve, place re-hydrated pho noodles in individual noodle bowls. Top with chicken legs, sliced onions, and scallions. Pour hot broth over chicken and noodles. Serve immediately, allowing guests to add herbs, bean sprouts, chilis, lime, and sauces as they wish.

5. Garnish items: 
+ 1 small white or yellow onion, thinly sliced
+ 1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions
+ 2 cups mixed herbs (cilantro, basil, and mint)
+ 2 cups trimmed bean sprouts
+ Thinly sliced Thai chilis
